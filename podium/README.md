# Podium

*Verified delegation for [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). A chief-of-staff
agent hands work to a roster of persistent bots, and a runner - not a model -
decides whether the work actually landed.*

You talk to one agent. It writes a brief, hands it to a specialist bot, and comes
back with an answer. Every job carries an acceptance check that **the runner
executes**, so "done" is a verdict rather than a claim. Jobs are detached and
survive the session that launched them. Every settled job leaves a receipt.

## See it work first

No model, no auth, no config. Thirty seconds:

```sh
./demo.sh              # run five jobs and print the receipts
./demo.sh --console    # the same, then open the desktop console on it
```

It uses a stand-in executor, so nothing calls a real model and your `~/.podium`
is untouched. It delegates five jobs — two that pass their acceptance check, one
given no check at all, one whose check fails, and one that gets rate limited —
then shows you which of them actually proved anything, and finally edits the
ledger in front of you so you can watch `podium audit` catch it.

## Should you use this?

Be honest with yourself first. There is a crowded field here and some of it is
better than this for most people:

- **[OpenMausBot](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot)** - the closest
  thing to an open Grok Bot. A chat app where each contact is a real Claude,
  Codex or Grok CLI on your own subscriptions, with cloud desktops and 500+ app
  integrations. Signed installers for macOS, Windows and Ubuntu. **If you want a
  polished desktop Grok Bot today, install this instead.**
- **[Rakazo](https://github.com/elie222/rakazo)** - persistent AI teammates on
  web, desktop and mobile, with voice, routines and peer delegation. Needs
  Postgres, Docker and a server. Excellent if you want a platform.
- **[pi-gui](https://github.com/minghinmatthewlam/pi-gui)** - a Codex-style
  desktop for Pi with worktrees, diffs and an integrated terminal. If you want a
  coding IDE around Pi, this is it, and Podium's tools show up inside it because
  they are ordinary Pi tools.
- **[CopilotKit/OpenBot](https://github.com/CopilotKit/openbot)** - governance
  first. Every action is checked against a CEL policy *before* it runs, with an
  audit row written first and a container plus browser profile per bot. If your
  problem is "what is this agent allowed to touch", that is the answer, and it is
  a different problem from this one.

Three different problems get called trust. OpenBot answers *may the agent do
this?* Agent Receipts and Nobulex answer *can the record be edited afterwards?*
Podium answers the third: **did the work actually land?**

It is for one thing those do not do: **it will not let an agent tell you the
work is done.** A job is verified only when a shell command the runner ran exited
zero. Everything else is recorded as unverified, permanently, and is one query
away. If that distinction does not matter to you, use one of the above.

It is also small on purpose - a few hundred lines of bash and one Pi extension,
readable in a sitting, with no database, no daemon and no server.

## What it does

```
  you ──► orchestrator ──► podium ──► detached job ──► executor ──► bot
          chief of staff   runner         │                         │
                                          │                         └─ prompt + memory
                                          ├── acceptance check (run by the runner)
                                          └── log.jsonl  (the receipts)
```

- **A bot is a directory.** `bot.md` is its system prompt, `memory.md` is durable
  notes prepended on every future job, `workspace/` persists between jobs.
- **The runner detaches every job** through `nohup` and an exiting parent, so
  init adopts it and the work outlives your terminal, your editor, and the
  orchestrator session.
- **The runner runs the acceptance check**, not the bot and not the orchestrator.
  A failing check turns the job `rejected`, whatever the bot reported.
- **Throttling is not a hang.** A job killed while its output shows a rate limit
  settles as `rate_limited`, so starvation never gets debugged as a crash.

## Status

v0, honestly labelled:

- **Runner: complete and tested.** 79 assertions, including a live check that a
  detached worker's parent pid becomes 1 after its launching shell exits, that a
  failed acceptance check rejects a job whose executor exited 0, and that editing
  or deleting a receipt is detected.
- **Desktop console: works, unsigned.** Boots, renders, and is smoke-tested
  headless with screenshots on every view. Not notarized, so macOS will need a
  right-click → Open the first time.
- **The Pi extension loads.** Verified against real pi 0.84.2: pi rejects a
  broken extension loudly, and this one loads silently with all eight
  registrations executing.
- **Never run against a live model.** Everything is proved with a fake executor.
  The first real run is yours.

## Requirements

macOS or Linux with bash and coreutils. The durability guarantee rests on
`nohup`, `ps` and process reparenting, so Windows is out rather than faked.

[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) as the harness:

```sh
npm i -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
pi           # then /login
```

Pi's `/login` covers ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex), GitHub Copilot, xAI, Claude,
OpenRouter and others. **Codex is the recommended executor** - OpenAI endorses
third-party harness use under Codex for OSS. See
[docs/research.md §5](docs/research.md) for what each subscription actually costs
you, including the Claude caveat.

Podium never reads, stores or passes a credential. You run the login command.

## Install

Read `SETUP.md` first - it is short, and it describes an agent writing files into
your configuration. Then point your agent at this directory:

> Set up Podium from this repo.

It interviews you, lists every file it will write, asks once, installs, and ends
with a live acceptance test.

## Using the runner directly

```
$ podium bots
scout          Fast codebase recon. Returns compressed, structured context.
implementer    Writes code against a brief. Smallest change that passes.
reviewer       Reviews a change for correctness and scope creep.

$ podium run implementer "Add a null check to parse() in src/parser.ts" \
    --check "npm test -- parser"
20260821-052308-155126519

$ podium status 20260821-052308-155126519
id=… bot=implementer status=done verdict=verified duration_secs=41 exit_code=0

$ podium ledger --unverified
20260821-052315-157325573  researcher   rate_limited  unverified
20260821-052313-1565818314 implementer  rejected      failed_check  exit 1
20260821-052311-155861591  reviewer     done          unverified
```

That last command is the point of the whole project. The third row is a job that
finished successfully and proved nothing.

`podium doctor` preflights everything. `podium verify <id>` re-runs a recorded
check by hand. Set `PODIUM_REQUIRE_CHECK=1` to refuse any job launched without
one.

Receipts are hash-chained, so the ledger is tamper-evident:

```
$ podium audit
79 receipt(s), chain intact.
head: 6a08b11f99f439be4b3ac36d58f481de858cbb4795b0a2ab3c80f8451e027c2d
```

Each receipt carries the SHA-256 of the one before it, and the newest hash is
kept separately because nothing chains to the last line yet. Editing a verdict,
deleting a receipt, or truncating the file are all detected and located. This is
hashing, not signing - it catches a bad edit or a torn write, not an adversary
with write access to the whole directory. If you need the stronger property,
[Agent Receipts](https://github.com/agent-receipts/obsigna) and
[Nobulex](https://github.com/nobulexdev/nobulex) do Ed25519 properly.

## The desktop console

```sh
cd desktop && npm install && npm start
```

Three views: **Talk** to the orchestrator, the **Roster** of bots and their
memory, and **Receipts** - every settled job with the check that ran and the
verdict it produced. Delegated jobs appear live on the right with their verdict
badge.

The conversation is the front door; the receipts are why it exists.

## Tests

```sh
./test/run.sh                 # runner:  79 assertions
cd desktop && npm test        # bridges: 51 assertions
cd desktop && npm run smoke   # the UI:  13 assertions + screenshots
```

None of them calls a real model or touches your roster. The smoke test seeds a
throwaway home with one job of every verdict, boots the console in a headless
Electron, drives every view, captures a screenshot of each, and asserts that the
console's unverified count matches `podium ledger --unverified` exactly. It needs
`xvfb-run` on Linux.

## Boundaries

- macOS and Linux only.
- Podium never handles secrets. Authentication is you, running the command.
- Bots share your filesystem. There is no sandbox in v0; run Pi under
  [Gondolin](https://github.com/earendil-works/gondolin) or a container if you
  need one.
- **An acceptance check is only as good as the person who wrote it.** The runner
  proves the check passed; it cannot prove the check was worth running. The
  ledger stores every check verbatim so a worthless one is visible rather than
  laundered.
- Fanning out multiplies token spend against a subscription priced for one
  person. Expect throttling before you expect failure, and read `rate_limited`
  in the ledger as exactly that.
